# CS1 Lonely Party Array

Lonely Party Array project coded in pure C with no IDE for Computer Science 1

Objectives:
- Implement fragment arrays that allocate and deallocate portions of themselves based on need in order to maintain memory efficiency.
- Gain advanced experience with dynamic memory management, pointers, and structs.
- Run tests to ensure that the program does not have any memory leaks.
- Manage a program with custom header files and multiple source files.

Program Summary: Implement an array-like structure, refered to as a Lonely Party Array, that will be used to solve an arbitrary problem related to storing integers in an 11 segment Lonely Party Array.

Note: These programs from CS1 were critical in my development of C programming skills. I encourage the reader to open the PDF file supplied in this repositiory, or any other repository labeled CS1_, and to browse through the program requirements.
